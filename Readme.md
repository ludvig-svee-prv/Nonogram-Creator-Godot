A small project to create a Nonogram creator that allows a user to both create nonograms, export them to JSON format and then load or send them to another user to play via the program.

To test the project, either download and then open it via the GODOT engine (With C# support) at: https://godotengine.org/download

Or if on Linux or Windows, download the project and run the appropiate app in the folder "ExecutableApplications". This is a debug binary to test the application without using the Godot Engine.
